    "# Project: Teacher Admin Portal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Teacher Admin Portal is a centralized dashboard designed to give teachers and administrators a unified view of student performance across multiple educational platforms. The goal is to reduce time spent navigating separate systems and improve data-informed decision-making for student support and intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Educators currently rely on multiple disconnected software systems to access student data such as assessment scores, attendance, and intervention history. This fragmentation creates inefficiencies, delays interventions, and increases administrative burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "Teacher Admin Portal aggregates student data from existing systems into a single, read-only dashboard, allowing staff to quickly assess student progress and identify areas needing attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features (Planned)\n",
    "- Unified student profile view\n",
    "- Assessment score summaries\n",
    "- Attendance tracking\n",
    "- Intervention and MTSS notes\n",
    "- Quick links to source systems\n",
    "- Role-based access (Teacher, Admin, Counselor)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Users\n",
    "- Teachers\n",
    "- School administrators\n",
    "- Counselors\n",
    "- Intervention specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "## MVP Scope\n",
    "- Read-only dashboard\n",
    "- One SIS integration (e.g., student demographics)\n",
    "- One assessment platform integration\n",
    "- Manual refresh or scheduled sync\n",
    "- Secure authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security & Compliance\n",
    "- FERPA-aware data handling\n",
    "- No modification of source data\n",
    "- Access restricted by role\n",
    "- Audit logging for access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Enhancements\n",
    "- Predictive risk indicators\n",
    "- Automated alerts\n",
    "- Custom reports\n",
    "- District-wide analytics\n",
    "- Intervention outcome tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Status\n",
    "Early concept and design phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "This project is intended for educational and exploratory purposes. Integration with district systems requires appropriate approvals and agreements.\n"
