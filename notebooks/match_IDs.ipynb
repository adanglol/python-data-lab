    "# Project : Matching Student IDs Between Two CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview \n",
    "This project compares student data between two separate CSV files to identify mismatches, duplicates, and potential data integrity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use case is inspired by education data systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "One system represents real-time operational data (e.g., Aeries).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another represents a snapshot-based reporting system (e.g., CALPADS).\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems may not always align perfectly. This project simulates the need to validate and reconcile student records across multiple data sources.\n",
    "## Project Goal \n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a data analysis workflow that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matches student records between two datasets using Student ID (SSID or Local SIS ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifies students missing from either dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Detects duplicate Student IDs within datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Produces summary outputs to highlight data discrepancies and support data quality assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Use Case Scenario\n",
    "In school data reporting, differences between operational and reporting systems can arise due to timing delays, inactive students, or data entry errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how a data analyst can reconcile student records, detect inconsistencies, and ensure reliable reporting for compliance and auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSID Matching when doing verifying fall 2 and certification reports \n",
    "- When run aeries query report we get list of students but aeries is using runtime data so we have to go to census day as well as including inactive students since CALPADS is snapshot and Aeries is realtime data\n",
    "- Once we ran aeries query and it reflected CALPADS there could be discrepancy still like how they go from EL to RFEP\n",
    "- Excel had sort by color we took one report aeries one and highlighted it all blue so we know\n",
    "- go to supporting report of certifictation report example 2.7 supports 2.4 and highlight columns\n",
    "- we want to compare both list of SSID or student ID and make sure they are all duplicates\n",
    "- the ones that are not duplicates and the discreppency that we check in aeires\n",
    "- This is problem we are solving so we dont have to do \n",
    "## Methodology / Approach \n",
    "The project follows a structured workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation – Both CSV files are loaded and column names standardized to ensure consistent formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Record Matching – Student ID (SSID or Local SIS ID) is used as the primary key to match records across files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison and Validation – Identify matched and unmatched records and detect duplicate Student IDs within each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Generation – Results are organized into structured output files and summary metrics to highlight discrepancies and overall alignment between systems.\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "The project produces two output files:\n",
    "\n",
    "discrepancies.csv → Contains Student IDs that are missing from either dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "matched_records.csv → Contains Student IDs that exist in both datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These outputs provide a clear view of which records are aligned across systems and which need attention for data quality purposes.\n"
