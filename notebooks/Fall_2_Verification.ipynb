    "# Project : Fall 2 Verification Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The Fall 2 Verification Automation project focuses on streamlining and validating the data verification process required for CALPADS Fall 2 certification. Fall 2 reporting is a critical compliance process for California school districts, requiring accurate staff assignments, FTE calculations, course sections, and demographic alignments across multiple systems. This project aims to reduce manual review, improve data accuracy, and surface potential errors earlier in the certification cycle through automated checks and structured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed with future extensibility in mind, allowing expansion to support additional CALPADS reporting cycles and evolving state reporting requirements.\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to automate key verification steps in the Fall 2 certification process by programmatically analyzing exported SIS and CALPADS-related datasets. The system identifies inconsistencies, missing records, and high-risk data issues before submission, supporting faster resolution and improved certification confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term, the goal is to evolve this tool into a broader CALPADS reporting support framework capable of adapting to new validation rules, data elements, and reporting windows as CALPADS requirements change.\n",
    "## Real-World Use Case Scenario\n",
    "A district data analyst prepares for Fall 2 certification by exporting staff, course section, assignment, and enrollment data from the SIS. Traditionally, verification requires manual cross-checking across spreadsheets, system screens, and static reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project:\n",
    "- The analyst uploads exported CSV files into the verification workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated checks validate staff FTE totals, SEID presence, role alignment, and course assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discrepancies (e.g., missing SEIDs, over-allocated FTE, unmatched staff records) are flagged\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary reports and exception files are generated for review and correction prior to certification submission\n",
    "\n",
    "In future phases, the same workflow could support additional CALPADS submissions by swapping or extending rule sets based on the reporting cycle.\n",
    "## Methodology / Approach \n",
    "1. Data Ingestion\n",
    "   - Import SIS and CALPADS-related exports (CSV format)\n",
    "   - Standardize schemas and data types\n",
    "2. Rule-Based Validation Engine\n",
    "    - Apply Fall 2–specific business rules\n",
    "    - Modular rule definitions to support future CALPADS cycles\n",
    "    - Clear separation of errors vs. warnings\n",
    "3. Data Integrity Checks\n",
    "    - Validate required identifiers (SEIDs, staff IDs)\n",
    "    - Verify FTE totals and staff assignment constraints\n",
    "    - Detect mismatches between SIS and CALPADS datasets\n",
    "4. Automation & Maintainability\n",
    "    - Python and Pandas-based implementation\n",
    "    - Reusable, testable functions\n",
    "    - Configuration-driven logic to accommodate CALPADS updates\n",
    "6. Reporting & Outputs\n",
    "   - Human-readable summary reports\n",
    "   - Exportable exception files for correction workflows\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "- Fall 2 Verification Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Overall certification readiness indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Error and warning counts by category\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exception & Correction Files\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Staff with missing or invalid SEIDs\n",
    "\n",
    "    - FTE inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Assignment or role misalignments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensible Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Documented rule definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Versioned outputs aligned to CALPADS updates\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Foundation for future reporting automation"
